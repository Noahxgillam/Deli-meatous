Your project is well-structured and provides a smooth ordering experience for customers at "Deli-meatous." The code is clean and thoughtfully written, with a strong emphasis on object-oriented principles. Below is the final review covering all classes, with recommendations for enhancements.

Strengths & Positive Highlights ✅
🔹 Encapsulation & Separation of Concerns: Each class is well-defined with clear responsibilities, making the code easy to maintain. 🔹 Modern Java Features: Use of switch expressions and streams ensures concise, readable code. 🔹 Flexible Order System: Order class allows multiple sandwiches, drinks, and chips while providing accurate total pricing. 🔹 Receipt Generation: The ReceiptManager efficiently saves orders with timestamps for record-keeping. 🔹 User-Friendly Input Handling: The Main class presents a clear menu-based interaction for customers.

Class-by-Class Review & Recommendations
1️⃣ Drink Class
✅ Efficient Price Calculation Using switch Expression ✅ Concise toString() Representation 💡 Enhancement Suggestion:

Add getter methods for size and name for better encapsulation.

Use enum to store drink prices inside Size for better scalability.

Example:

java
public enum Size {
SMALL(2), MEDIUM(2.5), LARGE(3);

    private final double price;

    Size(double price) {
        this.price = price;
    }

    public double getPrice() {
        return price;
    }
}
Then modify calculatePrice():

java
public double calculatePrice() {
return size.getPrice();
}
2️⃣ Sandwich Class
✅ Flexible sandwich customization with bread type, size, and toppings ✅ Well-handled price calculations 💡 Enhancement Suggestion:

Ensure List<Topping> is mutable by replacing List.of() with new ArrayList<>(toppings).

Optimize price calculations using streams for better readability.

Example:

java
public double calculatePrice() {
double basePrice = switch (size) {
case 4 -> 5.5;
case 8 -> 7;
case 12 -> 8.5;
default -> 0;
};

    return basePrice + toppings.stream().mapToDouble(Topping::getPrice).sum();
}
3️⃣ ReceiptManager Class
✅ Automatically generates receipt filenames based on timestamps ✅ Uses FileWriter with try-with-resources for safer file operations 💡 Enhancement Suggestion:

Improve exception handling by logging errors instead of e.printStackTrace().

Ensure Receipts folder exists before writing files.

Example:

java
File receiptDir = new File("src/main/resources/Receipts");
if (!receiptDir.exists()) {
receiptDir.mkdirs();  // Create directory if it doesn't exist
}
4️⃣ Order Class
✅ Tracks all ordered items efficiently ✅ Calculates total price correctly 💡 Enhancement Suggestions:

Optimize total price calculation using streams instead of explicit loops.

Improve toString() formatting for readability.

Example:

java
public double calculateTotalPrice() {
double totalSandwiches = sandwiches.stream().mapToDouble(Sandwich::calculatePrice).sum();
double totalDrinks = drinks.stream().mapToDouble(Drink::calculatePrice).sum();
double totalChips = chips.size() * 1.5;

    return totalSandwiches + totalDrinks + totalChips;
}
Refined toString():

java
@Override
public String toString() {
return String.format(
"Order Summary:\nSandwiches: %s\nDrinks: %s\nChips: %s\nTotal Price: $%.2f",
sandwiches, drinks, chips, calculateTotalPrice()
);
}
5️⃣ Main Class
✅ Well-structured menu-based ordering system ✅ Handles customer input efficiently 💡 Enhancement Suggestions:

Improve scanner input handling to prevent crashes from invalid input.

Convert scanner.next() to scanner.nextLine() where possible to consume entire lines.

Add input validation for choices.

Example:

java
System.out.print("Choose size (4, 8, 12 inches): ");
int size;
while (true) {
try {
size = Integer.parseInt(scanner.nextLine());
if (size == 4 || size == 8 || size == 12) break;
System.out.print("Invalid size. Please enter 4, 8, or 12: ");
} catch (NumberFormatException e) {
System.out.print("Invalid input. Please enter a number: ");
}
}
Final Thoughts & Improvements Summary
Your code is very well-written, following best practices and object-oriented principles. 👏 Here’s a summary of key improvements:

✅ Improve Scanner Handling → Ensure robust input validation to prevent errors. ✅ Optimize Price Calculation → Use stream().mapToDouble() instead of manual loops. ✅ Enhance File Handling in ReceiptManager → Ensure receipt directory exists before saving files. ✅ Improve String Formatting → Use String.format() for cleaner output in receipts and totals. ✅ Encapsulate Drink Prices in Size Enum → Better scalability and less redundancy.

🚀 Final Verdict: Excellent Work!
Your project is structured efficiently, intuitive for users, and coded with modern Java principles. If you implement these improvements, it’ll be even more optimized, scalable, and error-resistant. 🎉
